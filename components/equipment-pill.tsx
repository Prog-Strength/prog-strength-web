/**
 * Single source of truth for the equipment pill — the gear/setup a
 * given exercise requires. Today it's used on the exercises catalog;
 * import this anywhere else equipment needs to be surfaced (workout
 * summaries, filter chips, planning UI, etc.) rather than re-rolling
 * the color map.
 *
 * Color scheme follows the same /15 background + 300 text + /30
 * border pattern as MuscleGroupPill so the two pill types feel like
 * one design system. Hues are picked from corners of the Tailwind
 * palette that the muscle-group map doesn't already occupy heavily —
 * a little overlap is unavoidable but they tend to render in
 * different rows ("Targets" vs "Equipment") so confusion is low.
 * Unknown values fall back to stone (neutral, "uncategorized").
